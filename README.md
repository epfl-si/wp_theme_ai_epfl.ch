# ai.epfl.ch's Wordpress theme

This is the repository for ai.epfl.ch's Wordpress theme. It uses the new
Wordpress [Block themes] mecanisms.

The mockups are provided by [@jsnrynlds] in the [epfl-ai-center-ui]
private repository. A fork accessible by epfl-si is available
[here](https://github.com/epfl-si/epfl-ai-center-ui).

## Workflow

Once this reporitory is cloned, one can use the [Makefile]:
- `make mockup` will clone [@jsnrynlds]'s repository in the JasonTheme's 
  subfolder and update it if needed. This command will also build the theme.
- `make copy-assets` will retrieve some assets, such as logos or cascading
  styles sheets, and add them to the theme's assets folder.
- `make change-logo-url` will use [sed] to upate the URLs present in the 
  [style.css]; the one generated by [vite] includes an hash in them 
  (see [#378]).
