# ai.epfl.ch's Wordpress theme

This is the repository for ai.epfl.ch's Wordpress theme. It uses the new
Wordpress [Block themes] mecanisms.

The mockups are provided by [@jsnrynlds] in the [epfl-ai-center-ui]
private repository. A fork accessible by epfl-si is available
[here](https://github.com/epfl-si/epfl-ai-center-ui).

## Workflow

Once this reporitory is cloned, one can use the [Makefile]:
- `make mockup` will clone @jsnrynlds's repository in the JasonTheme's subfolder
  and update it if needed. This command will also retrive any needed asset, such
  as logos, and add theme to this theme asset folder.
- `make change-url` will use [sed] to upate the URL present in the [style.css];
  the one generated by [vite] includes an hash in them (see [#378]).
