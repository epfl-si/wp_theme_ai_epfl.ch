<p>Emerging applications and the big challenges of our time call for new fundamental research in AI. In this research area, we focus on new methodological developments and mathematical theory that will impact the upcoming decades.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, we need learning methods with improved efficiency in terms of data and computation, models that robustly adapt to changing environments, safe and explainable AI systems, and active learning strategies to overcome limitations of current predominately passive approaches.</p>

<p>In addition to theoretical and statistical foundations, our expertise covers new fundamentals in algorithm and model design for machine learning, as well as their integration in intelligent systems — ranging from small, highly power-​constrained hardware to large-​​scale data centers and cloud-​​based platforms.</p>

<p>The mission is especially exciting for me and my collaborators since it brings together many areas of our research interests, like dark matter and galaxy evolution, but also image processing and numerical simulations.</p>
